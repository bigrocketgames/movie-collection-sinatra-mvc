Updates for looks:
- Add navbar on all pages.
  - Have navbar link with login/signup or logout depending on if someone already logged in.
  - Have "Show Collection" if user logged in.
- Have index show links to other users collections to view.

Updates for function:
- Have a copy link to perhaps add another person's movie to logged in users collection?
    - This may change database configuration to need join table and has_many through connections.
