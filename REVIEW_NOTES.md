1. Make routes plural

  /users/1
  /users/jimmy
  /users/jimmy/movies

  /movies/1

2. Build out a session controller for login and signout

3. Use naming conventions for your views folders

  /movies/show.erb
  /movies/index.erb
  /movies/new.erb

4. Use active record validation to make sure that a user can not signup with an email or username that exists in the database users table
